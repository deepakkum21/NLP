For example: To a financial investor, the first meaning for the word \"Bull\" is someone who is confident about the market, as compared to the common English lexicon, where the first meaning for the word \"Bull\" is an animal. As such, there is a special lexicon for financial investors, doctors, children, mechanics, and so on.\n",
